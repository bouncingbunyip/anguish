<h1 id=Introduction align="center">Introduction</h1>
<h2 align="center">The Anguish Languish</h2>

<p>English words are astonishingly versatile and could readily be
    made to serve a new and extraordinary purpose, but nobody seems to
    care about this except <i>SPAL</i> (Society for the Promotion of the
    Anguish Languish).*</p>

<p>

<hr>

*<font size="-1">The members of SPAL are the persons who have written
    to the author concerning the Anguish Languish, especially the
    thousands who wrote to request copies of </font><a href="#Ladle Rat Rotten Hut"><font size="-1">Ladle
    Rat Rotten Hut</font></a><font size="-1"> after Arthur Godfrey's
    inimitable reading of it, on his television show. The society is very
    poorly organized, in fact few of the members even know they belong.
    There are no officers, no meetings, no convention, and, worst of all,
    from the point of view of the author and founder, no dues. </font><hr><p></p>

<p>In keeping with its lofty ideals and its slogan, <b>ANGUISH FOR
    EVERYBODY</b>, the Society is sponsoring this little text, which has
    three aims:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To improve the public's understanding of the Anguish
        Languish.</li>

    <li>To improve the academic standing of the Anguish Languish.</li>

    <li>To improve the social <i>and</i> financial standing of the
        Society.</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="center">Policemen and Magicians</h2>

<p>A visiting professor of Anguish, Dr. ________,* who, while
    learning to understand spoken English, was continually bewildered and
    embarrassed by the similarity of such expressions as <i>boys and
        girls</i> and <i>poisoned gulls</i>, used to exclaim:</p>

<p>

<hr>

*<font size="-1">This isn't his real name, nor is it intended to be
    the name of any other Anguish Languish professor, living or dead.
</font><hr><p></p>

<p>"Gracious! What a lot of words sound like each other! If it wasn't
    &#91;<i>sic</i>&#93; for the different situations in which we hear
    'em, we'd have a terrible time saying which was which."</p>

<p>Of course, these may not have been the professor's exact words,
    because he often did his exclaiming in Anguish rather than in
    English. In that case he would say:</p>

<p><i>"Crashes! Water larders warts sunned lack itch udder!
    Effervescent further delerent saturations an witch way harem, wade
    heifer haliver tam sang witch worse witch."</i></p>

<p>Dr. ________ was right, both in English and Anguish. Although
    other factors than the pronunciation of words affect our ability to
    understand them, the situation in which the words are uttered is of
    prime importance. You can easily prove this, right in the privacy of
    your own kitchen, by asking a friend to help you wash up a dozen cops
    and sorcerers. Ten to one, she'll think you said a dozen <i>cups and
        saucers</i>, and be genuinely surprised if you put her to work
    cleaning up even <i>one</i> police officer, let alone all the others,
    and the magicians, too.</p>

<p>If you think that she misunderstands merely because the two
    phrases sound somewhat alike and <i>not</i> because of the situation,
    read what SPAL's Committee on Housewives has to say:</p>

<p>"Presented with a dishes-piled-in-sink situation, several hundred
    well-adjusted housewives thought that <i>cops and sorcerers</i>
    referred to dishes, but seldom did normal subjects, interviewed under
    the same conditions, make the opposite mistake. When they were asked
    to help us wash <i>cups and saucers,</i> some women consented, some
    made stupid excuses, and some told us bluntly to go wash them
    ourselves, but <i>practically no one thought that we were talking
        about policemen and magicians</i>."</p>

<h2 align="center">What Anguish Really Is</h2>

<p>"The experiments described above, and hundreds of similar ones
    conducted by SPAL show that <i>an unbelievable number of English
        words, regardless of their usual meanings, can be substituted quite
        satisfactorily for others.</i> When <i>all</i> the words in a given
    passage of English have been so replaced, the passage keeps its
    original meaning, but all the words have acquired new ones. <i>A word
        that has received a new meaning has become a
    </i><b><i>wart</i></b><i>, and when all the words in the passage have
        become warts, the passage is no longer English; it's</i> Anguish.</p>

<h2 align="center">Are There Any Good Reasons to Study Anguish?</h2>

<p>This is not an altogether silly question, and it deserves the
    prompt and unequivocal answer any Anguish Languish enthusiast will
    give it.</p>

<p><i>"Watcher mane, ardor rainy gut raisins toe sturdy anguish?"</i>
    he will say, and will probably give you an impressive list of them
    which will certainly include the following:</p>

<p><i>1. Anguish is fun.</i></p>

<p>You and your friends can make a game out of learning Anguish, and
    you'll have fun developing your own style and observing each other's
    efforts. How to begin will be explained later.</p>

<p><i>2. Anguish Languish means verbal economy.</i></p>

<p>If words can be made to do double, triple, or even quadruple duty,
    it is obvious that we don't need so many of them. Wouldn't it be a
    comfort to know that, in the event of some unpredictable disaster
    wiping out half of our English vocabulary, we could, if we had
    learned Anguish, get along nicely with what we had left?</p>

<p><i>3. Anguish helps out in certain social situations.</i></p>

<p>People who aren't sure of themselves should learn Anguish. Suppose
    you have been asked to dinner by the president of your company and
    his wife. Since you haven't met your hostess, you have spent some
    time, before going, thinking up something to say that will really
    interest her. Finally you decide to ask, during the dinner:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bellowell, didn't I hear that your brother Henry was
    discovered to be in collusion with those election crooks?"</p>

<p>The moment arrives, but you no sooner get her attention than you
    have sudden misgivings. Too late to change your subject, you slip
    deftly into Anguish:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bellowell...deaden are hair ditcher broader Hennery worse
    dish-cupboard toe bang collision wet dozer liquor-chin crocks?"</p>

<p>Whether or not such a calamity is likely to occur seems entirely
    beside the point; in times like these one should be prepared for any
    emergency.</p>

<p>Chances are that everyone will be so fascinated by the graceful
    form of your question that not even your hostess will attach much
    importance to what you've asked.</p>

<p><i>4. Anguish relieves that terrible craving to tell dialect
    stories.</i></p>

<p>People who are addicted to telling dialect stories, or chronically
    frustrated because they can't tell them without Scotch brogue or
    Brooklynese getting mixed up with Deep South, will be overjoyed with
    Anguish. <i>Anguish is definitely </i>not<i> a dialect, since it
        consists</i> only <i>of unchanged English words which anyone can
        pronounce.</i> By imparting a delicate and indefinably exotic accent
    to one's speech, however, it not only provides a socially acceptable
    substitute for telling dialect stories, but adds to one's personal
    charm.*</p>

<p>

<hr>

*<font size="-1"><i>ANGUISH ANONYMOUS,</i> an organization of former
    dialect story tellers, sponsored by SPAL, can be called in difficult
    cases. </font><hr><p></p>

<p><i>5. Anguish improves your English</i></p>

<p>As your Anguish vocabulary increases, you'll find that your English vocabulary
    does, too, but you must be careful not to mix them up&#151;something which people
    orphan do when they begin to use words accordion to the way they sound rather
    than how they're spelled. Words which are rare in English are often common enough
    in Anguish, so you have new opportunities to see them. Suppose you're spending
    a week-end reciting nursery rhymes in Anguish to a happy group of children or
    immature adults, and come across <a href="#Sinker Sucker Socks Pants"> Sing
        a Song of Sixpence, A Pocket Full of Rye</a>. In Anguish, this, of course, is
    <a href="#Sinker Sucker Socks Pants">Sinker Sucker Socks Pants, Apocryphal Awry</a>.
    This will give you an unexpected chance to use the last two words.</p>

<p>You'd be surprised to know how many people haven't the faintest
    idea what a xyster is until they hear a SPAL member talking about his
    fodder, murder, broader, and xyster. This makes them want to look
    <i>xyster</i> up. When they do, they find that, although
    <i>xyster</i>* in Anguish, may mean <i>sister</i>, in English it's
    nothing in the world but a common raspatorium. Now raspatoria, and,
    therefore xysters are important surgical instruments, nice to know
    about before being scheduled for an aberration.</p>

<p>

<hr>

*<font size="-1"> The plural of <i>xyster</i> in Anguish, is
    <i>cisterns</i>. See, in this book, the story of </font><a href="#Center Alley"><font size="-1"><i>Center
    Alley</i></font></a><font size="-1">. </font><hr><p></p>

<p>Speaking of xysters, hominy people know what <i>higglery</i> is?
    Very few, yet it occurs in the Anguish Languish version of something
    as well known as:</p>

<blockquote>"Murder, mare argo art toe swarm?"

    <p>"Yap, mar doling dodder,</p>

    <p>Hank yore clues honor higglery larme</p>

    <p>An dun gore norther warder!"</p></blockquote>

<p>While you're looking up <i>higglery</i>, you might find
    <i>larme</i>, just a few pages away in <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html"><i>Webster's
        Unabridged</i></a>.</p>

<p><i>6. Practical Anguish.</i></p>

<p>Anguish can be used for group study at parties and entertainments,
    as a psychological test of something or other (we don't know just
    what)*, and as practice material in Speech and Typing classes.</p>

<p>

<hr>

*<font size="-1">A research psychologist plans to use <i>Anguish
    Languish</i> to provide data for a study entitled: <i>"Individual and
    Sex Differences in Configurational Perception of Artificially
    Contrived but Phenomenologically Comprehensible Auditory
    Stimuli."</i> This sounds as if it should mean something. </font><hr><p></p>

<h2 align="center">How Can One Learn Anguish?</h2>

<p>Read everything in this text aloud, and preferably in a group.
    Make a game of it.</p>

<p>You'll find it easier to understand Anguish when you <i>hear</i>
    it than when you see it. If you have trouble, listen to someone else
    read it to you, preferably someone who doesn't quite know what he's
    reading. This often gives the best effect. Watch what happens when
    the listeners understand better than the reader.</p>

<p>Don't try to read too fast and be sure to give all words their
    usual English pronunciation, regardless of the new meaning the word
    has acquired. An accurate pronunciation and good intonation are most
    effective.</p>

<p>3. Don't worry if you seem to have suddenly acquired a slight
    accent; your friends will tell you that this is most attractive.</p>

<p>The first item in this collection is a story familiar to all readers&#151;<a href="#Ladle Rat Rotten Hut">Little
    Red Riding Hood</a>. Or, as you can probably say now in Anguish, <a href="#Ladle Rat Rotten Hut">Ladle
    Rat Rotten Hut</a>.</p>

    a little fairy story told in other words&#151;words which are altogether different
    from the ones in the original version."</p>
