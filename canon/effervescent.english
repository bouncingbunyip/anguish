If it wasn't for the egg
    there wouldn't be a chicken
If it wasn't for the pig
    we wouldn't have bacon
If it wasn't for the ?
    there wouldn't be a ?
If it wasn't for the artist
    we wouldn't have pictures
If it wasn't for the classes
    we wouldn't have classrooms
If it wasn't for the bathtubs
    we wouldn't have bathrooms
If it wasn't for the talking
    we wouldn't have language
If it wasn't for the words
    nobody could speak English!
