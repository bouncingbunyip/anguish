Anguish
=======

To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguish_Languish)
The Anguish Languish, an ersatz language constructed from English language words, was created by Howard L. Chace, who collected his stories and poems in the book Anguish Languish (Prentice-Hall, 1956).[1] It is not really a language but rather a homophonic transformation created as a work of humor. Example: "Mural: Yonder nor sorghum stenches shut ladle gulls stopper torque wet strainers." This means: Moral: Under no circumstances should little girls stop to talk with strangers.

The main files are located in:  
app/  
canon/  
dictionaries/  
tests/

The files in the root directory do the following:  
index.php - displays a form for translating from or into Anguish from English  
append.php - a utility to append new transliterations from dictionaries/append.txt into dictionaries/lexicon.php  
about.php - a simple about page  
adhoc.php - a page for adhoc tests  
example.php - displays examples listed in the canon/ folder  
sort.php - another utility file, I've used it a few times but you probably won't ever need it.

The canon/ folder contains all the examples of Anguish (in text) that I've been able to find on the Internet.  The two versions have the same filename, but different extension.  For example; carloons.anguish has the Anguish text and carloons.english has the English version of the same text.  If I find more examples online, I will add them to the canon.

All of the translations or transliterations are located in the lexicon.php file.  The best way to add to the lexicon is to populate the append.txt file and then run append.php.

The append.txt file should have one translation per line, English first, followed by Anguish.  All spaces should be replaced with a hypen and any contractions should use &apos; instead of "'", like this:

english,anguish  
a-phrase,a-phrase  
isn&apos;t,isn&apos;t
